# FruitApp

FruitApp is a simple React web application that allows you to manage a list of fruits. You can add new fruits, edit their names, and delete fruits from the list. This application demonstrates various React concepts and features, including JSX syntax, functional and class components, props and state management, event handling, conditional rendering, and working with lists and keys.

## New Functionalities

### 1. Edit Fruits
You can now edit the names of existing fruits in the list. Click the "Edit" button next to a fruit, and you'll be able to modify its name. Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

### 2. Delete Fruits
You can delete fruits from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to a fruit. The fruit will be removed from the list.

### 3. Conditional Rendering
The application uses conditional rendering to show/hide elements. For example, the "Edit" and "Save" buttons are displayed conditionally based on whether you're editing a fruit or not.

### 4. Lists and Keys
The list of fruits is rendered using proper keys to ensure efficient React rendering.
